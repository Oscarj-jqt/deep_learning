# From Machine Learning to Deep Learning — Summary

## 1. Machine Learning (ML) Basics
- **Collect data:** Gather examples with input features and the target output.
- **Select features:** Choose which variables (features) are most relevant for prediction.
- **Train a model:** Use an algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) to learn the relationship between features and output.
- **Evaluate:** Measure the model’s accuracy (e.g., Mean Absolute Error) to see how well predictions match real data.

## 2. Deep Learning (DL) — Going Deeper
- Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks).
- **Layers and neurons:** Each layer contains units (neurons) that perform computations. Stacking many layers allows the model to learn more complex patterns.
- **Connections:** Neurons in one layer connect to those in the next, transforming information step by step.
- **Non-linearity:** Activation functions (like ReLU) let the network learn non-linear relationships.
- **Training:** The process is similar—use data to train the model and evaluate with metrics like MAE—but the model can now capture much more complex relationships.
- **Why deeper is better:** More layers and connections mean the model can learn subtle, abstract, or hierarchical patterns, making it powerful for complex tasks.

**Summary:**  
Deep learning builds on the same principles as traditional machine learning but uses deep neural networks to model much more complex relationships. This allows for better performance on difficult problems, as the network can automatically learn features and patterns that would be hard to design by hand.
