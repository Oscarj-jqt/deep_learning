# Binary Classification — Essential Notes

## 1. What is Binary Classification?
- Binary classification is a type of machine learning where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, 0/1, true/false).
- Examples: spam detection, disease diagnosis, etc.

## 2. Accuracy and Cross-Entropy
- **Accuracy:** Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Cross-entropy loss:** Measures how well the predicted probabilities match the true labels. Lower cross-entropy means better predictions.
