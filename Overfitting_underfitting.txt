# Overfitting and Underfitting — Essential Notes

## 1. What are Overfitting and Underfitting?
- **Underfitting:** The model is too simple and cannot capture the patterns in the data. Both training and validation loss are high.
- **Overfitting:** The model is too complex and memorizes the training data, but performs poorly on new (validation) data. Training loss is low, but validation loss increases.

## 2. Learning Curves
- Plotting training and validation loss over epochs helps spot underfitting and overfitting.
- Underfitting: Both losses stay high.
- Overfitting: Training loss drops, validation loss rises after a point.
