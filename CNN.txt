Convutional Neural networks

## 1. What is a Convolutional Classifier?
- A convolutional classifier is a neural network designed for image classification.
- It uses convolutional layers to extract features from images and classify them into categories.

## 2. Structure of a CNN
- **Base:** Pretrained convolutional layers extract features from input images.
- **Head:** New layers (often dense) are added to classify the extracted features into your target classes.
