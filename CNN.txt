Convutional Neural networks

## 1. What is a Convolutional Classifier?
- A convolutional classifier is a neural network designed for image classification.
- It uses convolutional layers to extract features from images and classify them into categories.

## 2. Structure of a CNN
- **Base:** Pretrained convolutional layers extract features from input images.
- **Head:** New layers (often dense) are added to classify the extracted features into your target classes.

## 3. Training a CNN
- Load image data and preprocess it for training.
- Use a pretrained base (like EfficientNet or ResNet) to leverage learned features.
- Attach a new head for your specific classification task.
- Compile and train the model on your dataset.

## 4. Example Workflow
```python
# Load and preprocess image data
train_ds = image_dataset_from_directory(...)
valid_ds = image_dataset_from_directory(...)

# Define pretrained base
pretrained_base = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(include_top=False)

# Attach head
model = keras.Sequential([
    pretrained_base,
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
