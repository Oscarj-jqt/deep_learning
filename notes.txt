Deep Learning

Deep learning is an approach where neural networks make deep stacks of computations to solve complex and hierarchical patterns.

It is used for tasks like natural language translation, image recognition, and game playing, often achieving human-level or better performance.

Each neuron in a neural network performs a simple computation, but the power of deep learning comes from the complexity and depth of the connections between these neurons.


We can represents that neuron by a mathematical formula :

y = wx + b 

y is the target data
x is the input, datasets we collected. Its connection to the neuron has a w weight
A neural network learns by modifying its weights
b is a constant we admit that does not influence y that much, it is there to make sure of any uncertainty
